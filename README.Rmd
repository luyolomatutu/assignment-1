## Assignment 1
## Hello Octocat
I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town. 
![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/images/octocat.png)

```{r setup, include=FALSE, fig.path='./figures/', fig.height= 8, fig.width= 8, fig.align='center'}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
## Assignment 2
```{r quick_look, echo=TRUE}
# R dataset
data("anscombe")
dim(anscombe)
names(anscombe)
head(anscombe, n=6)
tail(anscombe, n=6)
summary(anscombe)

```
## Assignment 3
```{r xy_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.path='./figures/', fig.height= 8, fig.width= 8, fig.align='center',fig.ext='svg'}

# R dataset
data("anscombe")
 # plotting of scatter plot
plot(x=anscombe$x1, y=anscombe$y1)
abline(lm(y1 ~ x1, data = anscombe))

```

## Assignment 4
# Chunk 4
```{r data_import, echo=TRUE}
# packages to read data for all chunks
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

#read data from analgesic.csv file
df<-read.csv("analgesic (1).csv")
```
# Chunk 5
```{r data_summary, echo=FALSE}

#contents of 'df'
dim(df)
names(df)
head(df, n=6)
tail(df, n=6)
summary(df)
```
# Chunk 6
```{r data_tidy, echo=TRUE}
# tidy data
df_1 <- gather(df, key = Measurements, value = value, Measurement_1, Measurement_2, Measurement_3, -ID)
df_2 <- group_by(df_1, ID, Group)
summarise(df_2, mean = mean(value))
```
## Assignment 5
# Chunk 1- Chicken Weights
* null hypothesis: growth rate of chickens do not depend on different feed supplements
* alternative hypothesis: growth rate of chickens depends on different feed supplements
```{r echo=TRUE}
# read data
x <- read.csv("file:///C:/Users/Wits-User/Desktop/stats revision/chick-weights (1).csv")

#tidy data
boxplot(x$weight ~ x$feed)

#statistical test
chickanova <- aov(weight ~ feed, data = x)
summary (chickanova)
```

## assumption that underlie the test
* use ANOVA when grouping factor is more than 3 groups
* assume normal distribution of data
* statistical test= one way ANOVA, DF= 5, p value< 0.05

## interpretation of the outcomes
* p is less that 0.05 therefore reject the null hypothesis.

#Chunk 2- The Hot Zone
* null hypothesis: outbreak of severe gastroenteritis is not caused by contamination of drinking water
* alternative alternative: outbreak of severe gastroenteritis is caused by contamination of drinking water
```{r echo=TRUE}
# read outbreak of gastroenteritis
x <- read.csv("file:///C:/Users/Wits-User/Desktop/stats revision/gastroenteritis (2).csv")
y <- xtabs(~Consumption + Outcome, data = x)
head(x)
table(x$Consumption, x$Outcome)

#plot data
barplot(y, beside = TRUE, ylab = 'water consumption', xlab= 'clinical presentation', main = 'investigation of gastroenteritis outcome', col= c("pink", "purple", "turquoise"))

legend('top', c("<1 glasses/day", ">4 glasses/day", "1 to 4 glasses/day"), fill = c("red", "orange", "yellow"))

#statistical test
z <- chisq.test(y, correct = TRUE)
z
```
## assumption that underlie the test
* three categorical variables from the same population
* trying to see if there is an association between the variables

## interpretation of the outcomes
* p value < 0.05, DF = 2
* p value is less than 0.05 therefore reject the null hypothesis

#Chunk 3- Nausea
* null hypothesis: ingestion of 5HT3-receptor blocker causes nausea
* alternative hypothesis: ingestion of 5HT3-receptor blocker does not cause nausea
```{r echo=TRUE}
#read nausea data
x <- read.csv("file:///C:/Users/Wits-User/Desktop/stats revision/nausea (1).csv")

#tidy the data
# changed the 40 from row 8, column 3 to 4, b/c I think it might be a typo, seeing that the scale goes from 0-6.

x[8,3]= 4
x

# plotting data 
plot(x$Nausea_before ~ x$Patient, type = "l", ylim = c(0,6), xlab = 'patient', ylab = 'nausea score', col = 'purple', main = 'rating of nausea before and after receiving chemotherapy')
lines(x$Nausea_after, col = 'pink')
legend("center", c("Nausea_before", "Nausea_after"), fill = c("purple", "pink"))

#statistical test
wilcox.test(x$Nausea_before,x$Nausea_after, paired = TRUE)
```
## assumptions that underlie the test
*  the data is non-parametric
* two measurements taken from the same individual

## interpretation of the outcome
* p< 0.05, therefore reject null hypothesis and accept alternative hypothesis

# Housing Prices
## null hypothesis
* the price of housing is not dependent on the interest rate

## alternative hypothesis
* the price of housing is dependent on the interest rate 
```{r echo=TRUE}
#read housing prices
x <- read.csv("file:///C:/Users/Wits-User/Desktop/stats revision/housing-prices (1).csv")

#data plot
plot (x$interest_rate,x$median_house_price_USD, main = 'The effect of interest rate house price', xlab = "interest rate", ylab = "median house price", pch = 19, col = "pink", fill = c("pink"))

abline(lm(x$median_house_price_USD~x$interest_rate, data = x), lwd = 3, col = "purple" )


#linear regression
x1 <- lm(x$median_house_price_USD~x$interest_rate, data = x)
summary (x1)

# diagnostic 1: homoskedasticity
plot(x= x1$fitted.values, y=x1$residuals, xlab = "fitted values", ylab = "residuals", pch = 19, col = "pink", main = "Homoskedasticity")
abline(h=0, lwd = 3, col = "turquoise")

# diagnostic 2: gaussian residual distribution
qqnorm(x1$residuals, pch = 19, col = "pink")
qqline(x1$residuals, lwd = 3, col = "grey")

#plot generalized linear model
glm(x$median_house_price_USD~x$interest_rate, data = x)

```

## assumptions that underlie the analysis
* The reason behind plotting a generalized linear model is because the residuals are not normally distributed. Diagnostic 1 presents with residuals that show a shape, not random distribution. secondly, the residuals do not have the same variance. Diagnostic 2 presents with residuals that are not fitted on along the plot.

## interpretation of outcomes
p= 0.01937, therefore p< 0.05 so reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis
df= 15
